                  as it impacts the metric cardinality (cf https://rhobs-handbook.netlify.app/products/openshiftmonitoring/telemetry.md/#what-is-the-cardinality-of-a-metric).
                  In general, avoid setting very high cardinality labels such as IP
                  or MAC addresses. "SrcK8S_OwnerName" or "DstK8S_OwnerName" should
                  be preferred over "SrcK8S_Name" or "DstK8S_Name" as much as possible.
